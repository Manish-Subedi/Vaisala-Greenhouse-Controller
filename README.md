### Final project for ARM processors and Embedded Systems operations course.

# Description
As it is well-known, carbon dioxide supplementation on plant growth and production is a key factor in a healthy greenhouse environment. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an essential component of photosynthesis (also called carbon assimilation), whose process is of extremely importance in humanâ€™s wellbeing as it is the source of energy and food for all organisms. <br> <br>
As there is a need to create a system that helps the healthy growth of plants, especially in enclosed spaces, the project has been developed. Therefore, the project's objective is to create a greenhouse's CO2 fertilization controller system, where the CO2 level is maintained by a controller at the level chosen from the local user interface.
